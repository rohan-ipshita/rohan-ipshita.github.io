							<h2>Here with you</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Ages ago,<br>
						Under the sparkling night, I met her.<br>
						The tree danced to the songs of the wind.<br>
						She smiled at the stars and<br>
						treasured the moon in her eyes.<br>
						She made me promise<br>
						to keep our story a secret,<br>
						as she believed in jinxes.<br>
						And her gorgeous giggles<br>
						belong to a whole another plane.<br>
						Every moment beside her was a<br>
						silly little truce between time and turmoil.<br>
						As the last second near,<br>
						she held my hand<br>
						and asked me to close my eyes.<br>
						Foolishly me,<br>
						never got a chance to say goodbye.<br>
						But as u know,<br>
						it was ages ago,<br>
						and she believed in jinxes.<br>
						Here she is,<br>
						beautiful she calls our love,<br>
						She blends into my soul saying,<br>
						"if its meant to be, it'll happen"<br>
						Yes, it happened,<br>
						we found us, in our magical story.

						<h3><b>Butterflies</b></h3>
						<p> I know fairy tales come true because I have you. I want to say that i am in love with you. I am mad for you. Can we go for cofee today?
							or forever? If someone had told me that there was a single person out there that I would never stop loving, I would have found it humorous. Then I met you and my whole world changed. We are like tom and jerry, we fight, we chaze , we love, we play, but at the end me(Tom) catches Jerry(you) and have him for dinner üòÇ.
						<br></br>So here is a story for u love..</p>

						<h3><b>Hope </b></h3>
					  <p>When a surgeon operated a little girl, complications started to arise. She lost a lot of blood and was in need of blood transfusion. However, she had blood type O, which wasn‚Äôt available in the hospital. The surgeon, therefore, asked the girl‚Äôs little brother, who was an O-type as well, if they could draw blood from him. He explained that it was incredibly important, or has he said, a matter of life and death. The young boy, seemingly afraid, sat a couple of moments in silence until he finally agreed. He got up and hugged his parents, wishing them goodbye. After the nurses had taken the blood from him, he whispered anxiously if they knew how many minutes he had left to live. He was absolutely convinced that he was going to die so that his sister could live. And he was willing to do so. When the nurses realized that the young boy thought he was going to die, they cheered him up and explain to him that he had many wonderful and joyful decades left to live.<p>
